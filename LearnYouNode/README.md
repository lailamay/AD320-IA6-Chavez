Following the same guidelines for the Javascripting assignment from last week, use npm to globally install the LearnYouNode package.
PRO-TIP - Complete the Week 6 and Week 7 reading first. These exercises will be much easier if you have completed the reading. 

npm install -g learnyounode
Note: Mac/linux users may have to use sudo. 

After installation, launch learnyounode by entering the following command in your terminal

learnyounode 
From the menu, complete any 7 of the 13 available exercises. These exercises are more difficult than the JavaScripting exercises, so if you get stuck on one, move on the the next and try that. 

Follow the instructions from the app to test and verify your solutions. 

For submission, please create a new github repo called AD320-IA6-<LastName> and commit all of the completed exercises. Submit a link to the repo on canvas. 

Extra credit!
2 bonus points will be added if you have a single commit for each exercise. This means you would start the first exercise, create your file, code your solution, verify it in LearnYouNode, and after it passes, stage, and commit JUST THAT FILE. Repeat this for every exercise and push once at the end when you have completed the assignment. 

Additionally, I will award extra points for working solutions to the remaining 6 exercises. 
You have to submit 7 of the 13 exercises for full credit, but every exercise beyond the 7th will net you 3 points. 

If you complete all 13 assignments, with a single commit for each one, and every solution works, you will get full credit plus 20 extra credit points. That's enough to completely null out one missed individual assignment. Extra credit will not be awarded for late submissions. No Exceptions.
